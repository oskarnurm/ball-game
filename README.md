# Ball Game

This is a simple ball game made in Unity with C#. The player controls the ball to collect objects scattered throughout the platform. Each object offers a random number of points. The player has the option to pause the game and adjust the settings to a low detail level, which disables particle effects. Additionally, the player can switch between night and day modes and adjust the volume.
